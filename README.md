# ⌚ WristCrafters  
### Smartwatch Text Entry Interface (CMU Graphics / Processing)

## 🔍 Project Overview

**WristCrafters** is a smartwatch text entry system designed and implemented using **Processing (CMU Graphics)**. The project explores how users can efficiently and accurately type text on a **small, constrained smartwatch screen**, focusing on interaction design, usability, and iterative improvement through user studies.

The system was developed through multiple prototypes, user testing rounds, and refinements, resulting in a final design that significantly improves **typing speed, accuracy, and user confidence** compared to the provided scaffold design.
